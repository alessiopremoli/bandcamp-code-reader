# Bandcamp Code Reader
A `pdf2json` based converter from a pdf bandcamp code file (the one you use to print them, rename it as `bandcamp_codes.pdf` for now) to a csv. Sometimes labels provides you only this kind of pdf and I got tired of copying and pasting them.

## Instructions
- clone the project
- `npm i`
- copy your pdf inside the source folder and rename it as `bandcamp_codes.pdf`
- run `npm start`
- :rocket: profit (the csv is saved in the output folder)
